    "bio":"I am an athlete at heart, with an entrepreneurial spirit, a knack for management, system architecture,  and a passion for coding. Born in a small town in north of France, I made my move to Lille where I work as an enggineer student in IT domains, but also for other projects alongside my school. I love to create and tend to keep a few too many projects on the go at a time. Outside of work I am an avid racing sports, golf player and tennis player. I love to travel and lead a fairly nomadic lifestyle. I also like travel and I dream of being able to take my work with me while travelling the world.",
